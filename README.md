# Spring-Pendulum
Data gen and analysis for spring pendulum for morphological computation. Morphological computation is a version of Reservoir computing, where instead of using a hard to train RNN, a reservoir with a linear readout is used instead. 
The goal of the project was to simulate an elastic tentacle arm to act as a "physical reservoir" and to show that it was possible to do computation with it using the various spring lengths as the readout.
